This is a stripped down subset of elfutils to specifically support Mesen-S'
debugger. GNU-specific C semantics have been removed in favor of standard ones
so it may be built with VS2019.

Autotools files have been removed in favor of Mesen's makefile and VS projects.

The original README follows:


The elfutils project provides libraries and tools for ELF files and DWARF data.

The project home is http://elfutils.org/

To build a release do: ./configure && make && make check
Please check the configure summary to make sure all recommended
features are enabled. There should be no failures after make check.
